# Systems Design

Building scalable, production-ready applications is both art and science.
Science, in that it requires knowledge of many topics in computer engineering;
art, in that it demands an eye for making smart design choices and piecing
together the right technologies.

## Design Fundamentals

These are concepts that are the building blocks of systems desing questions.
These can be divided in four categories:

- **Fundational Knowledge**: These are the concepts on which all systems design
  questions rely on - Like Client - Server Model, Network Protocols
- **Key Characteristics of Systems**: Availability, Consistensy, Throughput...
- **Components of the System**: Load Balancers, Proxies, Databases...
- **Actual Tech**: Available tech that will allow the system to be build. AWS,
  Nginx, Redis...
