# API Design

## Pagination

When a network request potentially warrants a really large response, the relevant API might be designed to return only a single **page** of that response (i.e., a limited portion of the response), accompanied by an identifier or token for the client to request the next page if desired.

Pagination is often used when designing **List** endpoints. For instance, an endpoint to list videos on the YouTube Trending page could return a huge list of videos. This wouldn't perform very well on mobile devices due to the lower network speeds and simply wouldn't be optimal, since most users will only ever scroll through the first ten or twenty videos. So, the API could be designed to respond with only the first few videos of that list; in this case, we would say that the API response is **paginated**.
