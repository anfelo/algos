# Specialized Storage Paradigms

## Blob Storage (Binary Large Object)

Widely used kind of storage, in small and large scale systems. They don't really count as databases per se, partially because they only allow the user to store and retrieve data based on the name of the blob. This is sort of like a key-value store but usually blob stores have different guarantees. They might be slower than KV stores but values can be megabytes large (or sometimes gigabytes large). Usually people use this to store things like **large binaries, database snapshots, or images** and other static assets that a website have.

Blob storage is rather complicated to have on premise, and only giant companies like Google and Amazon have infrastructure that supports it. So usually in the context of System Design interviews you can assume that you will be able to use GCS or S3. These are blob storage services hosted by Google and Amazon respectively, that cost money depending on how much storage you use and how often store and retrieve blobs from that storage.

## Time Series Database

A **TSDB** is a special kind of database optimized for storing and analyzing time-indexed data: data points that specifically occur at a given moment in time. Examples of TSDBs are InfluxDB, Prometheus, and Graphite.

## Graph Database

A type of database that stores data following the graph data model. Data entries in a graph database can have explicitly defined relationships, much like nodes in a graph can have edges.

Graph databases take advantage of their underlying graph structure to perform
complex queries on deeply connected data very fast.

Graph databases are thus often preferred to relational databases when dealing with systems where data points naturally form a graph and have multiple levels of relationshipsâ€”for example, social networks.

### Cypher

A **graph query language** that was originally developed for the Neo4j
graph database, but that has since been standardized to be used with other
graph databases in an effort to make it the "SQL for graphs."

Cypher queries are often much simpler than their SQL counterparts. Example
Cypher query to find data in **Neo4j**, a popular graph database:

```
MATCH (some_node:SomeLabel)-[:SOME_RELATIONSHIP]->(some_other_node:SomeLabel {some_property:'value'})
```

## Spatial Database

A type of database optimized for storing and querying spatial data like locations on a map. Spatial databases rely on spatial indexes like quadtrees to quickly perform spatial queries like finding all locations in the vicinity.
